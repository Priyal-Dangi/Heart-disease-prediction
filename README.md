# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
# Artifiial intelligence  #pickle  #openapi  # oneDAL
Basically, this model includes patient diagnoses for those with heart problems. This AI/ML model is to predict wether a person is with heart disease or not.

Here, we explore datasets with different no. of attributes required for prediction using a number of different visualization techniques.
Create ML models  of supervised learning of all kinds that can be used to determine if a patient has heart disease or not.
Export the best model and forecast into a text file.
Then with pickle library, saved the models inot .pkl files.
Next, we used oneDAL library/tool for data analysis of the various models
Took into consideration the best model.
Then make the prediction of the disease

The models used to develop this predivtion tools are below:
K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Gaussian Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest,
Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost

Naive bayes model showing the higher accuracy, so selected it as best model  and then deployed.
